# String Indexing and Accessing

print(a[3])                       # Printing the third character of our string.


# String Slicing

# String Concatenation

print("Hello" + "World")          # Adding the two string without assigning them to variable.

b = "Hello"                       # Adding the string "Hello" to variable a.

c = "World"                       # Adding the stirng "World" in the variable c.

print(a+b)                        # Adding the variables consisting of strings.

# String Replication

d = "abbbg"                       # Adding the string "abbbg" to the variable d.

# String Method

a = "aAAaaAAaa"                   # Defining a variable consisting string.

#upper( ) case method

print(a.upper())                  # Converting and printing all the characters of string into upper case.

#lower( ) case method

print(a.lower())                  # Converting and printing all the characters of thse string into lower case.

# capitalize( ) method
